    "text": "Hey, Iâ€™m Matt. I moonlight as a sport scientist in Americaâ€™s favorite version of football. In previous lives, Iâ€™ve worked as an analyst in baseball, spent a little time as a professor, and spent a really long time as an applied sport scientist/S&C coach. Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with athletes in a range of sports, including soccer, basketball, volleyball, bobsled and skeleton, and XC skiing.\nMy main focus is on maximizing player performance while managing fatigue and injury risk. To that end, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time developing and implementing athlete monitoring systems, building data visualizations and reports for stakeholders at all organizational levels, and performing in-depth post-mortem analyses to drive future programming decisions.\n\n\n Experience\nDirector of Sport Science (2021 - Current)\n   | New York Jets\nAnalyst, Performance Science (2019 - 2021)\n   | Kansas City Royals\nPerformance Coach (2018 - 2019)\n   | Chinese Olympic Committee\nAssistant Professor (2017 - 2018)\n   | LaGrange College\nLead Sport Scientist - Menâ€™s Soccer (2012 - 2017)\n   | East Tennessee State University\n\n\n\n Education\nPhD in Sport Physiology & Performance (2017)\n   | East Tennessee State University\nMA in Exercise Physiology (2014)\n   | East Tennessee State University\nBS in Exercise Science (2011)\n   | East Tennessee State University"

    "text": "Because Iâ€™m a Masochist\nWell, I havenâ€™t written a blog post in going on 5 years now, so what better way to get back into the swing of things than to write an entire series about a highly technical topic Iâ€™m not all that great at? ðŸ˜ƒ This is definitely a case of blogging about something so I can use it as a reference when I forget a few months years from now. At any rate, Iâ€™m going to be shedding some digital ink on the {box} package while building up a set of functions to analyze my running data.\n\n\n{Box} in a Nutshell\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know how if youâ€™ve never written code in any other language than R before and you try to pick up something like Python or C++ orâ€¦just about anythingâ€¦and you suddenly see statements like these?\n```{cpp}\n#include <vector>;\nusing namespace std; // Don't do this, by the way\n```\n```{python}\nfrom pandas import * # Don't do this either\nfrom plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_point, facet_wrap\nimport numpy as np\n```\nOn the flip side, letâ€™s hypothetically say youâ€™ve just updated the {tidytable} package in R (background in R or otherwise) and you get this error:\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidytable)\n\nError in fifelse(condition, args$true, args$false, args$missing) : \n'yes' is of type NULL but 'no' is of type character. Please make sure both arguments have the same type.\nCalls: .main ... run_hook_plot -> hook -> ifelse -> if_else -> fifelse\n```\nHypothetically, you get that error only when rendering a {quarto} document; itâ€™s not reproducible otherwise. You then, hypothetically, spend the better part of a day and a half researching the error and reading the {quarto} source code â€™til you finally find the root cause (a namespace conflict between {tidytable} and {quarto} thatâ€™s causing an ifelse() to be overwritten by the {tidytable} variant). Hypothetically, you then have to open Github issues in both packages to figure out a solution that doesnâ€™t break your entire reporting framework at your jobâ€¦hypothetically /r/suspiciouslyspecific.\nThankfully, that hypothetical error has been fixed now, but the song and dance I just described is absolutely bewildering to folks coming from languages with stricter scoping rules."
