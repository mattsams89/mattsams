    "text": "Hey, I’m Matt. I moonlight as a sport scientist in America’s favorite version of football. In previous lives, I’ve worked as an analyst in baseball, spent a little time as a professor, and spent a really long time as an applied sport scientist/S&C coach. I’ve had the chance to work with athletes in a range of sports, including soccer, basketball, volleyball, bobsled and skeleton, and XC skiing.\nMy main focus is on maximizing player performance while managing fatigue and injury risk. To that end, I’ve spent a lot of time developing and implementing athlete monitoring systems, building data visualizations and reports for stakeholders at all organizational levels, and performing in-depth post-mortem analyses to drive future programming decisions.\n\n\n Experience\nDirector of Sport Science (2021 - Current)\n   | New York Jets\nAnalyst, Performance Science (2019 - 2021)\n   | Kansas City Royals\nPerformance Coach (2018 - 2019)\n   | Chinese Olympic Committee\nAssistant Professor (2017 - 2018)\n   | LaGrange College\nLead Sport Scientist - Men’s Soccer (2012 - 2017)\n   | East Tennessee State University\n\n\n\n Education\nPhD in Sport Physiology & Performance (2017)\n   | East Tennessee State University\nMA in Exercise Physiology (2014)\n   | East Tennessee State University\nBS in Exercise Science (2011)\n   | East Tennessee State University"
